# revolut-app
A simple RESTful API for money transfer between accounts.
Built using JavaEE8, it also uses eclipselink + apache derby as an in memory datastore. 
Junit and mockito are used for unit testing. 
System-tests are being ran with Jersey, a reference implementation of Jax-rs  and was fully tested on a Payara 5 application server.
